# TreeRegexLib C++ implementation

To build this project, `cd` into the `src` directory (e.g. `cd src/`).  This folder contains the source code to build the TreeRegexLib tools and contains the source code for the libraries.

To build, run `make`. The `Makefile` requires a `C++11` compatible version of `g++`.  If you would rather use `clang`, change the `CXX=g++` to `CXX=clang++`.  The source code requires a modern compiler (C++11 support) - modern versions of GCC or Clang will suffice.

It will produce binaries in the `src` directory.
